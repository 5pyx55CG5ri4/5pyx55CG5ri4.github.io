`I am a programmer who loves programming and technological innovation. Exercise occasionally, cook. Most importantly, I have a girlfriend who I love deeply, she is the biggest support and motivation in my life, and I will love her for the rest of my life. Life will go by slowly but my blog will live on github forever and I am so happy to have the opportunity to share my story with you`
